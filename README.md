The problem that can be found in this folder are part of the Algorithms and Data Structures that I took in Q2 of my first academical year. The reason most of them are commited in a single day is that I had them on a problem solving website and I  decided to move them on my GitHub after almost one year. I would also like to mention that I have no contribution in the classes that are part of theLibrary folder because they were given to us as helper classes.
